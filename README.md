## Practicing Express Concepts and Practices

### What's in this?
This project covers a couple of concepts that are (in my opinion) somewhat important in web development:
    - Using templates/partials to deliver less repetitive HTML
    - Capturing parameters from GET requests
    - Using logic based on parameters from the get request
    - Iterating through mock data to create dynamically generated presentations of data
      - I'm literally just presenting titles and authors in a list to emulate a list of posts lol
    - Setting up a static file structure for css to be used across many files
    - Adding objects to a list via post requests... doesn't utilize anything like patch/put or delete to remove them, though...

### What I learned?
- I really don't like javascript but here we are :-D
- How to implement logic in .ejs files
- How to pass context/parameters to my HTML files
- An idea of how to set up css. 
  - I've only done it once with reference so I haven't really "learned" or memorized how to do it so I'll need reference next time but that's an issue for next time.
- Handling post requests in express (at least a bit... this was simple in my app but had no validation or data scrubbing...)
- How to utilize redirect
- I like Django's template tagging better.
